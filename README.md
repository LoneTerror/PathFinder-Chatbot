# Pathfinder AI - Chatbot Backend ðŸš€

A simple, stateless, and scalable Node.js Express server that acts as a backend for the Pathfinder AI mobile application. This server provides a secure proxy to the Google Gemini API, handling AI chat completions.

## Features âœ¨

* **Simple & Lightweight:** Built with Express.js for minimal overhead.
* **Gemini API Integration:** Connects to Google's `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` model to provide fast and intelligent responses.
* **Stateless API:** A single `/chat` endpoint that processes one prompt at a time, making it easy to scale.
* **Secure:** Keeps your Google Gemini API key safe on the server, never exposing it to the client application.
* **Environment-Ready:** Uses a `.env` file for easy configuration of API keys and server ports.
